Add to Calendar

Add the style information to the header of the webpage. Before the </head>

Add the event code after </em></p> for each event. 
  - Update image file <img src="Easter Triduum Schedule of Events _ Catholic Extension_files/Add to Calendar.png" alt=""/>
    Only need to do this once. Can copy and paste after. 
  - Edit event information, title, start, end, address (web address), description. 
  - Each time you copy a new event you will need to change the following code... <ul class="new-cal"> & document.querySelector('.new-cal').appendChild(myCalendar) just add a new number after "new-cal" in each one e.g. "new-cal2"
